### What does the programming subteam do?

##### Programming the RoboRIO

The programming subteam is responsible for writing the code that runs on the RoboRIO. The RoboRIO is one of the most crucial parts of a FRC robot, and it contains a micrpocessor along with several input/output pins used for controlling different parts of the robot.

As a member on the programming team, you will be responsible for writing the code to control different parts of the robot, such as the drivetrain or a claw, and also integrating that code with controller inputs.

In order to do this, you will use the [WPILib Library](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/), which contains everything you need to interface with anything that will be connected to the RoboRIO, such as motors and sensors.

In addition to programming the robot, the programming subteam is
