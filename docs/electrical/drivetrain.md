## Types of Drive Trains

FRC allows 5 types of drive trains: Tank Drive, Mecanum Drive, Omni Drive, Swerve Drive, and H-Drive.

### Tank Drive

The tank drive train is the simplest to build and consists of two tracks with half wheels on each side. The robot's directional movement is determined by how much power is being delievered to each track on the robot. If equal power is being send to both tracks the robot will drive forwad and backwards. If more power is being given to the left side the robot will turn left, more power to the right it'll turn right. 
### Mecanum Drive
- Four wheels, each controlled by an independent gearbox
- Total of 4 motors and 4 gears
- Rollers around the wheel, mounted at 45 degrees 
- Used best in strafing
### Omni Drive
- Allows a robot to instantly change direction without turning the wheel 
- Require individual speed control motors for each wheel
- Poor traction and bad for pushing
- Either 3 or 4 wheels
- 4 wheels are either angled at the corners (x-drive) or placed on the center of the sides of the drive base
### Swerve Drive
- specifically designed for constant spins and turns
- 4 wheels rotate on their own and each will is independently driven 
### H-Drive (Slide-Drive)
- Structured similar to tank drive with a horizontal wheel in center
- 5 wheels and rely on Omniwheels instead of traction
