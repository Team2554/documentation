### Color Sensor 
The color sensors use an IR Camera to detect color. The sensor requires 3.3 volts of power and its effective range is from one to ten centimeters. Located on the color sensor is a white LED that can be toggled with a hardware switch.

### Pneumatics Control Module
The PCM is a device that contains all of the inputs and outputs required to operate 12V or 24V pneumatic solenoids and the on board compressor. The PCM is enabled/disabled by the roboRIO over the CAN interface. The PCM contains an input for the pressure sensor and will control the compressor automatically when the robot is enabled and a solenoid has been created in the code. The device also collects diagnostic information such as solenoid states, pressure switch state, and compressor state. The module includes diagnostic LEDâ€™s for both CAN and the individual solenoid channels. 

### Voltage Regulator Module
The VRM is an independent module that is powered by 12 volts. The device is wired to a dedicated connector on the PDP. The module has multiple regulated 12V and 5V outputs. The purpose of the VRM is to provide regulated power for the robot radio, custom circuits, and IP vision cameras. Note: The two connector pairs associated with each label have a combined rating of what the label indicates (e.g. 5V/500mA total for both pairs not for each pair). The 12V/2A limit is a peak rating, the supply should not be loaded with more than 1.5A continuous current draw. 

###  Spike H-Bridge Relay
The Spike H-Bridge Relay from VEX Robotics is a device used for controlling power to motors or other custom robot electronics. When connected to a motor, the Spike provides On/Off control in both the forward and reverse directions. The Spike outputs are independently controlled so it can also be used to provide power to up to 2 custom electronic circuits. The Spike H-Bridge Relay should be connected to a relay output of the roboRIO and powered from the Power Distribution Panel.

### Servo Power Module
The Servo Power Module from Rev Robotics is capable of expanding the power available to servos beyond what the roboRIO integrated power supply is capable of. The Servo Power Module provides up to 90W of 6V power across 6 channels. All control signals are passed through directly from the roboRIO

### Axis M1013/M1011/206 Ethernet Camera
The Axis M1013, M1011 and Axis 206 Ethernet cameras are used for capturing images for vision processing and/or sending video back to the Driver Station laptop. The camera should be wired to a 5V power output on the Voltage Regulator Module and an open ethernet port on the robot radio.

### OpenMesh OM5P-AN or OM5P-AC Radio
Either the OpenMesh OM5P-AN or OpenMesh OM5P-AC wireless radio is used as the robot radio to provide wireless communication functionality to the robot. The device can be configured as an Access Point for direct connection of a laptop for use at home. It can also be configured as a bridge for use on the field. The robot radio should be powered by one of the 12V/2A outputs on the VRM and connected to the roboRIO controller over Ethernet.

### The Compressor
The compressor can be wired directly to the Compressor Out connectors on the PCM. If additional length is required, make sure to use 18 AWG wire or larger for the extension.

### The Pressure Switch
The pressure switch should be connected directly to the pressure switch input terminals on the PCM. There is no polarity on the input terminals or on the pressure switch itself, either terminal on the PCM can be connected to either terminal on the switch. Ring or spade terminals are recommended for the connection to the switch screws.

### Solenoids
Each solenoid channel should be wired directly to a numbered pair of terminals on the PCM. A single acting solenoid will use one numbered terminal pair. A double acting solenoid will use two pairs. If your solenoid does not come with color coded wiring, check the datasheet to make sure to wire with the proper polarity.

### Solenoid Voltage Jumper
The PCM is capable of powering either 12V or 24V solenoids, but all solenoids connected to a single PCM must be the same voltage. The PCM ships with the jumper in the 12V position as shown in the image. To use 24V solenoids move the jumper from the left two pins (as shown in the image) to the right two pins. The overlay on the PCM also indicates which position corresponds to which voltage. You may need to use a tool such as a small screwdriver, small pair of pliers, or a pair of tweezers to remove the jumper.
