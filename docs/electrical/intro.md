### Building the Eboard

The Electrical subteam is responsible for building and maintaining the RoboRIO and its components. The RoboRIO is the heart of a computer that powers an FRC robot. The RoboRIO is the most crucial part of an FRC robot, and it contains a microprocessor along with several input/output pins used for controlling different parts of the robot.

As a member of the electrical team, you will be responsible for assembling the e-board. The e-board is what Team 2554 calls the entire computer that manages the robot. The electrical team is the bridge between programming and mechanical.
