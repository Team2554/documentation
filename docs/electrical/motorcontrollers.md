### DMC-60 and DMC-60C Motor Controller
The Jaguar Motor Controller from VEX Robotics (formerly made by Luminary Micro and Texas Instruments) is a variable speed motor controller for use in FRC. For FRC, the Jaguar may only be controlled using the PWM interface

### SD540B and SD540C Motor Controllers
The SD540 Motor Controller from Mindsensors is a variable speed motor controller for use in FRC. The SD540B is controlled using the PWM interface. The SD540C is controllable over CAN. Limit switches may be wired directly to the SD540 to limit motor travel in one or both directions. Switches on the device are used to flip the direction of motor travel, configure the wiring polarity of limit switches, set Brake or Coast mode, and put the device in calibration mode

### SPARK Motor Controller
The SPARK Motor Controller from REV Robotics is a variable speed motor controller for use in FRC. The SPARK is controlled using the PWM interface. Limit switches may be wired directly to the SPARK to limit motor travel in one or both directions. The RGB status LED displays the current state of the device including whether the device is currently in Brake mode or Coast mode

### SPARK MAX Motor Controller
The SPARK MAX Motor Controller from REV Robotics is a variable speed motor controller for use in FRC. The SPARK MAX is capable of controlling either the traditional brushed DC motors commonly used in FRC or the new brushless REV Robotics NEO Brushless Motor. The SPARK MAX can be controlled over PWM, CAN or USB (for configuration/testing only). The controller has a data port for sensor input and is capable of closed loop control modes when controlled over CAN or USB.

### Talon Motor Controller
The Talon Motor Controller from Cross the Road Electronics is a variable speed motor controller for use in FRC. The Talon is controlled over the PWM interface. The Talon should be connected to a PWM output of the roboRIO and powered from the Power Distribution Panel.

### Talon SRX
The Talon SRX motor controller is a CAN-enabled "smart motor controller" from Cross The Road Electronics/VEX Robotics. The Talon SRX has an electrically isolated metal housing for heat dissipation, making the use of a fan optional. The Talon SRX can be controlled over the CAN bus or PWM interface. When using the CAN bus control, this device can take inputs from limit switches and potentiometers, encoders, or similar sensors in order to perform advanced control such as limiting or PID(F) closed loop control on the device.

### Victor 888 Motor Controller / Victor 884 Motor Controller
The Victor 888 Motor Controller from VEX Robotics is a variable speed motor controller for use in FRC. The Victor 888 replaces the Victor 884, which is also usable in FRC. The Victor is controlled over the PWM interface. The Victor should be connected to a PWM output of the roboRIO and powered from the Power Distribution Panel.

### Victor SP
The Victor SP motor controller is a PWM motor controller from Cross The Road Electronics/VEX Robotics. The Victor SP has an electrically isolated metal housing for heat dissipation, making the use of the fan optional. The case is sealed to prevent debris from entering the controller. The controller is approximately half the size of previous models.

### Victor SPX
The Victor SPX motor controller is a CAN or PWM controlled motor controller from Cross The Road Electronics/VEX Robotics. The device is connectorized to allow easy connection to the roboRIO PWM connectors or a CAN bus chain. When controlled over the CAN bus, the device has a number of the closed loop features also present in the Talon SRX. The case is sealed to prevent debris from entering the controller.
