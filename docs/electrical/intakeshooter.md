## Shooter

### Arc Shooter
The Arc Shooter was a piece of a system that allowed the robot to aim and launch balls. Its top conveyor is comprised of a set of six wheels placed on two bars of extruded aluminum and controlled by two motors, which are controlled by Talon SRXs, handling three wheels each. The shooter itself is a sheet of bent aluminum from an aircraft simulator and eight lime-green compliant wheels. The wheels are controlled by a belt attached to a motor, located behind the aluminum. 
## Intake

### Top Conveyor
The top conveyor is the set of six attached to the extruded aluminum mentioned earlier. It grips the ball to compress them and allows the ball to reach higher speed when exiting the top conveyor and into the shooter. 

### Horizontal Intake
The horizontal intake consists of seven wheels, six of which are Omni wheels that redirect the ball toward the top conveyor upon entry. The wheels are controlled using an SPX.
