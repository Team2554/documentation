# Mechanical Team Documentation
<hr/>

## Intro
The Mechanical Team is in charge of creating a prototype and the physical construction of the robot. They train new members to safely use power tools and handle build equipment to create a practice field to use before competition. They also design components such as drive chains, the chassis, and shooters. Students in this sub-team build the skeletal structure of the robot, and efficiently arrange the motors, electronics, and various mechanisms onto the robot.
